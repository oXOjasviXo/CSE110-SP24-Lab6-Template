1) I would put it in a GitHub action. Why:
   - with actions I can automate tests everytime code is pushed into the repo thus establishing a CI pipeline
   - I and other devs get immediate feeback with actions on every push which can help catch bugs early
   - the tests will be run in the same environment everytime thus can consistently identify whats wrong
   - the automation frees devs from running tests manually and forgetting to do so
